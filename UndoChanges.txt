I worship Shri Hari, whom the vedas sing,
who has king of birds as vehicle, who gives liberation,
who takes away pride of enemies.
who is favourable to his devotees, who is the root (cause) of this tree like world
who ends the suffering of life
I worship that Sri Hari always ||5||

I worship Shri Hari, who is powerful among all devatas, who is superior in three worlds,
who is only one, who is always calm in war, who is supreme among warrios,
who lives in the bank of ocean,
I worship that Sri Hari ||7||
